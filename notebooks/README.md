Notebooks
=========

This folder contains exploratory or legacy notebooks for the Noah Portfolio Q&A project.

Core app: use `main.py` (Streamlit) at the project root.

Guidelines:
- Do not commit large outputs.
- Avoid storing secrets; rely on environment or Streamlit Secrets.
- If experimenting with embeddings/models, keep cells lightweight.

Ignored: `.ipynb_checkpoints/` via `.gitignore`.
