He meets with project managers to discuss generative‑AI use cases, surfaces frontline constraints from sales, and helps evaluate feasibility and success criteria.","collaboration, PM, requirements"
Collaboration & Soft Skills,What role does Noah usually play in a team project?,"A bridge role: aligns non‑technical stakeholders and engineers, clarifies requirements, and focuses on measurable business outcomes while contributing hands‑on prototypes.","teamwork, bridge, alignment"
Collaboration & Soft Skills,How does Noah explain technical ideas to non‑technical people?,He decomposes concepts into recognizable parts and uses analogies. Example: a call summarizer = a transcript generator (speech‑to‑text) plus an AI writer that condenses key points into next‑step bullets.,"communication, analogy, explain"
Career Goals & Motivation,Why does Noah want to transition into software/AI?,He has seen how AI changes decision‑making and productivity. He wants to combine domain knowledge from sales with engineering skills to build tools that improve customer experience and team efficiency.,"motivation, transition, productivity"

Career Goals & Motivation,Why hire Noah over another candidate with a CS degree?,"He pairs practical sales experience with growing technical capability, which helps him prioritize problems that matter, translate requirements, and deliver grounded, explainable solutions—skills that are critical in real enterprise deployments.","differentiator, business impact, translation"
Career Goals & Motivation,What excites Noah most about working here?,"Opportunities to ship useful AI features quickly, learn from strong engineering teams, and measure results against real KPIs such as time‑to‑resolution, adoption, and customer satisfaction.","excitement, KPIs, impact"
Tech Stack,What UI/runtime is used for a quick demo interface?,"Streamlit provides a lightweight UI with forms, sidebar diagnostics, and simple layout for headshot and buttons. It runs on Python 3.13 in this project template.","streamlit, ui, python 3.13"
Tech Stack,What is the core framework for orchestration?,"LangChain acts as the orchestration layer for loading data, chunking, embeddings, vector store management, and the RetrievalQA chain.","langchain, orchestration"
Tech Stack,How is the data layer organized?,A CSV (noah_portfolio.csv) is the authoritative source of background knowledge. FAISS stores embeddings on disk (faiss_index/) for fast nearest‑neighbor retrieval with low operational overhead.,"csv, faiss, index"
Tech Stack,Which models are used and why?,"OpenAIEmbeddings (e.g., text-embedding-3-small) convert chunks and queries into vectors with good quality‑to‑cost ratio. ChatOpenAI (e.g., GPT‑4 class per config) generates grounded answers from retrieved context, with low temperature for determinism.","openai, embeddings, chatopenai"
Tech Stack,What does the RAG retrieval flow look like?,"(First run) Create/refresh index → CSV rows to documents → embed → store in FAISS. 
Query time → embed question → FAISS similarity search (top‑k with score threshold) → compose prompt with retrieved context → ChatOpenAI → answer + sources.","RAG, flow, similarity search"
Tech Stack,How is configuration and secrets management handled?,"config.py centralizes paths, model names, temperature, top‑k, and thresholds. OPENAI_API_KEY is loaded from Streamlit Secrets or environment variables and only initialized when needed (lazy singletons).","config, secrets, env"
Tech Stack,What helper utilities exist?,"langchain_helper.py provides lazy singletons for LLM and embeddings, a function to create or refresh the FAISS index, a quick existence check, a controlled prompt builder, and a get_qa_chain() that wires RetrievalQA and returns source docs for transparency.","helpers, singletons, retrievalqa"
Tech Stack,How is performance handled?,Caching: Streamlit @st.cache_resource caches the chain after first construction. The app avoids re‑embedding unless the index is rebuilt. Lazy model initialization prevents cold starts when simply loading the page.,"caching, performance, streamlit"
Tech Stack,What diagnostics and error handling are included?,"Sidebar diagnostics check key presence, embedding test, and index existence. Runtime errors are surfaced with clear messages; if the FAISS index is missing, auto‑build logic can create it. UI remains stable because model init is lazy and exceptions are caught.","diagnostics, errors, stability"
Tech Stack,How does the system stay secure?,Keys are never hard‑coded; they are pulled from secrets/env. The vector index and any logs remain local to the deployment container. The LLM is instructed not to fabricate and to acknowledge when context is missing.,"security, keys, fabrication"
Tech Stack,How is this relevant to real enterprise applications?,"The same pattern—RAG over vetted documents with logging and analytics—maps to SOPs, product catalogs, policies, and support runbooks. It provides freshness without model retraining, auditability via source docs, and measurable KPIs via logging (e.g., deflection rate, time saved).","enterprise, SOPs, auditability"
Personal,Can Noah really eat 10 hotdogs in one sitting?,Yes. Noah can eat 10 hotdogs in a single sitting. This is a fun personal fact he sometimes shares as an icebreaker.,"personal, fun, hotdogs, ten"
