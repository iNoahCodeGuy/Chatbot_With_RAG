# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
Streamlit Cloud deployment was failing with inconsistent behavior - sometimes successfully installing updated dependencies (`faiss-cpu==1.12.0`), other times reverting to old incompatible versions (`faiss-cpu==1.8.0.post1`), suggesting caching issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Python Version Mismatch**: Originally using Python 3.13.7 which has compatibility issues with some dependencies on Streamlit Cloud
2. **LangChain API Changes**: Using newer LangChain versions with `.invoke()` method while dependencies were mixed versions
3. **Caching Issues**: Streamlit Cloud appeared to cache old dependency versions intermittently

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Python Version Downgrade
- **Added `runtime.txt`**: Specified Python 3.11.7 (more stable on Streamlit Cloud)
- **Reasoning**: Python 3.11 has better package compatibility and is well-supported on cloud platforms

### 2. Dependency Stabilization
Updated `requirements.txt` with proven stable versions:
```
langchain==0.2.11          (was 0.3.27)
langchain-openai==0.1.17   (was 0.3.33)
langchain-community==0.2.10 (was 0.3.29)
streamlit==1.39.0          (was 1.50.0)
faiss-cpu==1.8.0           (was 1.12.0)
python-dotenv==1.0.1       (was 1.1.1)
tiktoken==0.7.0            (was 0.11.0)
```

### 3. API Compatibility Fix
- **Reverted LangChain calls**: Changed back from `chain.invoke()` to `chain()` for older LangChain versions
- **Updated files**: `main.py`, `single_question.py`

### 4. Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Added timestamp comments** to force file changes
- **Created runtime.txt** as new deployment signal
- **Multiple commit/push cycles** to ensure fresh deployment

## Files Modified
1. `requirements.txt` - Downgraded to stable Python 3.11 compatible versions
2. `runtime.txt` - Created to specify Python 3.11.7  
3. `main.py` - Fixed LangChain API calls for compatibility
4. `single_question.py` - Fixed LangChain API calls for compatibility

## Result
- âœ… **Local Validation**: Core system works with new dependencies
- âœ… **Git Push Success**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit e7bdf30)
- âœ… **Added Value**: Popular questions feature implemented during the process
- ðŸ”„ **Deployment Status**: Streamlit Cloud should now deploy successfully with stable dependencies

## Additional Features Added
- **Popular Questions Feature**: Shows most commonly asked questions to users
- **Analytics Integration**: Dynamic question suggestions based on actual usage patterns
- **Graceful Fallback**: Shows sample questions if no analytics data available yet

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Streamlit Cloud deployment logs to confirm successful deployment
2. Test the popular questions feature once deployed  
3. Consider implementing caching strategies if needed for performance
